Trycolix

Trycolix is a little trojan that will rename your window titles, showing flashing scenes, playing disturbing sounds,
random cursor clicks, open programs and it calls 2 undocumented features like RtlAdjustPriviledge and NtRaiseHardError
even this can harm your computer and overwrites mbr and disable TaskMgr and Registry Tools (Not work on windows XP).

Creator: GetMbr
Programming language: C

Before the destruction begins, there's 2 warning, so
nothing will happen when running by an accident.
User Account Control will also appear in Windows Vista and newer.
Without admin privileges, it won't be able to overwrite the MBR. So
be sure to run as admin (it will run as admin by default)! On Windows XP
you can just run it anyway.
