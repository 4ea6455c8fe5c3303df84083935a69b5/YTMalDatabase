Hyptionium trojan by GetMbr. 
Programming lang: C++

This software is not safe on your real machine. So if you want to keep your computer safe, just delete this program!

This little trojan is made under the course of 2 weeks, and it can overwrite your mbr or (Master boot record) to make 
it unusable. Also it can show flashing lights and loud and disturbing noises then it can move the program window,
randomly moving your cursor, random cursor clicks, renaming window titles and contents and it can triggers the BSOD
(Blue Screen of Death) after the payloads are finished.

Thanks for wipet for fix some bugs in the bytebeat code.
